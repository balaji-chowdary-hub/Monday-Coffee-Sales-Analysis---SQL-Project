# Monday-Coffee-Sales-Analysis---SQL-Project
This project analyzes coffee sales data using SQL to uncover key business insights. It involves database creation, table relationships, joins, aggregations, and sorting to identify the top 3 cities by total sales along with population metrics. The project demonstrates practical SQL skills for real-world sales and location-based analysis.

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to analyze coffee sales data using SQL to understand sales performance across different cities. By aggregating order data and linking it with customer and city information, the project aims to identify top-performing cities and support data-driven business decisions.

## Objectives

Analyze coffee sales data to evaluate city-wise revenue performance
Identify the top 3 cities generating the highest total sales
Understand the relationship between population and sales distribution
Apply SQL joins, aggregations, and sorting to solve real-world business problems
Strengthen hands-on SQL skills through practical data analysis

## Tools & Technologies

SQL (MySQL) – Database creation, joins, aggregations, filtering, and ranking
Relational Database Concepts – Primary keys, foreign keys, and table relationships
Git & GitHub – Version control and project documentation
VS Code / MySQL Workbench – SQL query development and execution

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Total Sales – Sum of revenue generated from coffee orders
City-wise Sales Contribution – Sales grouped by each city
Top 3 Revenue-Generating Cities – Cities ranked by total sales
Population vs Sales Analysis – Comparison of city population with sales performance
Average Sales per City – Mean sales value across cities

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Total Sales
Total revenue generated from all coffee orders.
City-wise Total Sales
Revenue contribution of each city to overall sales.
Top 3 Revenue-Generating Cities
Cities ranked based on highest total sales.
Average Sales per City
Mean sales value calculated for each city.
Population vs Sales Ratio
Comparison of city population with total sales to assess demand intensity.
Sales Concentration (%)
Percentage of total sales contributed by top-performing cities.
Customer Contribution by City
Number of customers contributing to sales in each city.

## Key Insights

A small number of cities contribute the highest share of total coffee sales.
High population does not always guarantee higher sales, indicating strong regional demand differences.
The top 3 cities show significantly higher revenue compared to others, making them ideal targets for expansion and marketing strategies.
Sales concentration highlights opportunities to optimize inventory and promotions in high-performing locations.
